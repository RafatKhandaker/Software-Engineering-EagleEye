				<p>Once there was a very normal guy named Smenen that lived a very normal life style. He lived with his parents even though he was old enough to get his own place and drink. He was more of a laid back guy. Till one day his mom got tired of his attitude and that he wasn’t providing money to the house. It wasn’t only with his mom that he had problems with, but with people from the streets that he owed money to because he used a lot of drugs. He smoked weed on a daily bases. Due too the poor community he lived in. One day he experiences a drive by, by a much known guy to the police department. Luckily he didn’t get hurt but like any mother would do, she sent him with his cousin Poncho in the East Bay in the City of Hayward. </p>
				<p>Once he got to the airport his cousin was there to pick him up. He was in a 1985 Monte Carlo Super Sport . It was a shiny black that shined so much that it could blind you from the reflection, As Smenen saw Poncho pull up to where he was waiting he greeted him with a handshake and a hug. He quickly noticed that they were very different; he noticed that Poncho was very neat. And he dressed baggy. So when they were driving back to Ponchos place he noticed that his neighborhood was a very friendly one. When they got out the car this pretty Latina girl came up to where the cousins were and surprised poncho and got him from the back. Hugging poncho she looked happy while smenen was staring at her with his mouth open he said DAM! She looked at him and said “are you smenen?” and he replied “yes” she Looked at Poncho and said “babe omg I didn’t know your cousin was coming.”</p>
				<p> Then Poncho said “oh yea sorry it was sudden, he had problems at his hometown but were going to change his ways huh smenen?” Poncho said looking at him. And Smenen looking down answered “hum yea I guess” They got too the front door of the apartment and opened he door. Smenen eyes got huge. He hadn’t seen a place so neat in his life. Poncho showed him to his room. The next day Smenen woke up and walked all over the apartment and couldn’t find anybody so he went to take a walk to the park and relax.</p>
