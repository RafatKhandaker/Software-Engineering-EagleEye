/* --------------------------- Error Explanation ------------------------------------

     Compiler errors indicated that the printf statement was missing a closing quotation mark & the comment line was not closed.

	 Errors also suggested that lines after 13 could not find closing tags because of the error on line 13. 

	 C is a sequential language & a syntax error in one line can cascade down onwards to other written statements.
