Simply solving Mesh Analysis with Determinants with JAVA, without cheating !!

I am going to solve Mesh Analysis, simply by asking the user the minimum amount of questions, needed to solve Mesh Analysis.

Instead of using the classical algabraic method, I am going to use the Determinant & matricies method to make use of Two dimensional array in Java.
