Simply solving 3x3 Mesh Analysis using Determinants with JAVA, without cheating !!

I am going to solve Mesh Analysis, simply by asking the user the minimum amount of questions, needed to solve Mesh Analysis.

Instead of using the classical algabraic method, I am going to use the Determinant & matricies method to make use of Two dimensional array in Java. 

This Problem only works for mesh analysis with 3 loops, does not work with 2 or 4. Program becomes incredibly complex for scalability. Will assess a more complex algorithm to determine patterns for solving matricies with scalability
