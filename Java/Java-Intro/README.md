# JAVA-Programs
Intro to Java Programming 
MY Progress... 
	
	Java is a mathematical modeled program designed for Engineers. It is "Object-Oriented," meaning that the program is 
designed to create and define objects based on it's properties. This was an advantage for engineers because they define real-world objects when creating programs.
Unlike "non-object oriented," which call all it's modules into a single script. The program flourished because of it's 
ability to to be cross-compiled with different OS systems ( Windows, Mac, Linux, Orignal Unix-based) and programs as well (Jruby, Jython). The
Grand-daddy program, C/C++, was a high lvl machine programming language that is compiled into "machine bits" to communicate directly to the hardware 
of the computer, Which was complex and required massive libraries to be extracted for coding and different for every operating system. Java, by oracle
produced a virtual machine (JVM) that runs a translation layer between the machine code and the program itself, it is known as an interpreter. The Java
Interpreter translates "Java Byte-codes into machine language," also, it is built inside every operating system so the same program can run inside it without
the need to be re-translated. In summary, Java is a multi-platform, Cross-Compatible, High-lvl programming language which made it easier for developers and 
software engineers to create programs for multi-layered systems. 

	In this repository I wrote all my Java code, commented them as thoroughly and as neatly as I could.
